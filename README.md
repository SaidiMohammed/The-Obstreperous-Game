# The Obstrepouros Game
 
 This project is a study of the humanâ€™s manifestation of negative feelings towards computers. We chose frustration as the negative emotion to investigate and in order to do that, we will define frustration and its triggers a game to manifest the frustration within the user and give a response to our questioning : Can this situation where a human gets angry at an obstreperous computer, be comparable to human to human scenario ?
